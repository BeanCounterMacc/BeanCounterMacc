#About
First and foremost, I love computational problem solving, and analysis. Ever since my first venture beyond Microsoft Excel, writing my first program to analyze, and then visualize that data, I have been obsessed with finding ways to integrate it into all my projects. I’ve come to deeply appreciate the increased breadth, and depth of insight, I’m able to gain in my work, through the integration of data analysis tools.
  
Data analytics provides a very rare and satisfying balance of creative and analytical thinking. My first venture in data analysis, as an auditor, was to analyze accounting transactions to test assertions being made about particular business accounts. Then, as a senior accountant, I used data analysis tools to create dashboards for key business metrics. And now, as a business analyst, I use data analysis to identify problems, streamline processes, and report on key metrics, for various components of the manufacturing process. The point which I knew I had found a passion for data analysis, was when I would catch myself relishing the thought of work, after work! It is the creative process, behind the integration of powerful things, in an effort to improve the human condition, which I really crave.
