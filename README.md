## About     [<img src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-icons@3.0.1/icons/linkedin.svg' alt='linkedin' width='20' height='20'>](https://www.linkedin.com/in/linkedin.com/in/jameswdrysdale/) 

First and foremost, I love computational problem solving, and analysis. Ever since my first venture beyond Microsoft Excel, writing my first program to analyze and then visualize data, I found myself proactively seeking out projects, which would allow me to integrate analytic tools.

My first venture with data analysis, as an auditor, was to use analytic tools on accounting transactions to test assertions being made about particular business accounts. Then, as a senior accountant, I applied data analysis tools to create dashboards on business performance. Now, as a business analyst, I use these tools daily to help businesses identify problems, streamline processes, and report on key performance metrics. As I reflect over the evolution of my career, Iâ€™ve come to deeply appreciate how these tools amplify insights in my work.

The point which I knew I had found a passion for data analysis, was when I would catch myself relishing the thought of work, after work! Data analytics offers a tremendously satisfying levels of creative and analytical thinking. It is the creative process, behind the integration of powerful things, in an effort to improve the human condition, which I really crave.
